# Copier - Bookshelf Dataset

This is our copier template for generation of new datasets for the [BookShelf](https://climate-resource.github.io/bookshelf/).
It is built to work with [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#quick-start).

The template itself lives in `template`.

# Installation


It is expected that `uv` is installed globally.
`uv` will then be used to manage the installation of `copier`
and other project depenedencies.

Before getting started with development, you will need to install the virtual environment.

```
make virtual-environment
```

# Usage

To start a new repository run `copier` with our template:

```bash
copier copy --trust gh:climate-resource/copier-bookshelf-dataset
 $path_to_my_new_repo
```

It will ask you lots of questions.


### Copier template tester (ctt)

We use [copier template tester (ctt)](https://copier-template-tester.kyleking.me/)
to generate the output of using our template.
This output is stored in the `tests/regression/ctt` folder which is tracked by git
and automatically updated by our pre-commit hooks.
This folder provides a way for us to easily see the impact that changes to our template
have on generated repositories under different possible answers to our copier questions.

Put another way, ctt provides a pure regression test of our template,
making sure that any changes to the output it generates are immediately obvious
and trackable over different commits.
